Hello, sir. I am Rohit Jha from the Faculty of BSc Hons Computing. My ID is 11782276. We have a final year 1st-semester assignment for the Mobile application module. My mobile application is a flutter Chat application using MongoDB. Here is my application. Okay, sir, I am describing the project that I have completed for this semester.
Alright, let's begin. Here is my application. This section is the sign-in area, and this one is the register or signup section. I will guide you through step by step and provide the code for these sections that I have implemented. Let me share the code for the sign-in and signup sections. Okay, let's proceed.
Now, I am signing in to showcase the application. Here is my application dashboard, where we can engage in conversations. I will now demonstrate the real-time chat functionality. As I write and send messages, they will instantly appear on the other side. To achieve real-time functionality, I implemented Socket.IO. Additionally, the application displays the timestamp for messages and indicates online status.
I also implemented a group chat feature. Here is the chat room where users can engage in group discussions. Moving on, I will show you all the code I have written in Flutter Dart. This includes testing sensors and the backend implementation. Furthermore, I will display the backend API codes. You can see all the backend code.
Now, let me demonstrate my MongoDB setup, where all chat data is stored. Here is MongoDB. Thank you for your time, sir. Goodbye.
